Hi, I'm Anton. I have coding experience in Java, JavaScript, Python, C, and HTML/CSS. I don't have much database experience at all but these past two summers I've done some freelance web development, doing most of my coding on the front end. My primary interests include Machine Learning and AI. I don't have any concrete ideas for this project yet but outside of CS I listen to a lot of music and play/follow sports (as well as fantasy sports) so I'd be especially interested in creating a web application based around these activities.
