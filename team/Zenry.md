Howdy all, my name is Zenry. 
I'm fairly proficient in Java, R, HTML, and CSS. 
I've done some minor webdev in the past and not that much database but I am interested in gaining some! 
I don't have any complete final project ideas at the moment but I'm open to ideas. 
I've taken/taking some bio and public health classes about health data so that's something I'm interested in. 
I know video/audio production and editing so that's a potential plus.
